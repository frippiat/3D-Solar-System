# Interactive 3D Application Development

## Context in which the project has been done:
This project is developed as part of the **CSC_4IG01_TP Exercise - OpenGL Programming** course at Télécom Paris by Kiwon Um. This course focuses on creating interactive graphics applications using modern OpenGL (version 3.3 and later). 

## General Description:
This project involves the development of an interactive 3D application that simulates an artificial solar system using OpenGL. The application allows users to visualize and interact with 3D objects, primarily spheres representing celestial bodies.
The project has the following components:
- **Triangle Drawing**: Initial steps include rendering a colored triangle by setting up vertex positions and colors.
- **Sphere Mesh Creation**: The project progresses to generating a sphere mesh, which is crucial for representing planets in the solar system.
- **Phong Shading**: A Phong lighting model is implemented to enhance the visual realism of the spheres.
- **Solar System Simulation**: The program simulates a solar system with three planets: a sun, an earth, and a moon, each with specific properties and transformations.
- **Dynamic Animation**: The application features animated transformations, where planets orbit and rotate, creating a dynamic visual experience.
- **Texturing**: The project adds realism by applying textures to the planets, enhancing their appearance.
- **Extensions**: The exercise encourages further exploration and enhancements, such as different shading techniques and interactive navigation.
